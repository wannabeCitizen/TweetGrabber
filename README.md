TweetGrabber
============

Using geduldig's TwitterAPI, here you'll find a piece of python code that is being
used to grab JSON data from the Twitter API.  It's a pretty basic implementation
for a class I'm in on big data, but for any newbies to the Twitter API or anyone 
looking for a quick way to start getting something from Twitter - this will work great.
Just remember to go to geduldig's TwitterAPI repo first so you have the dependencies
in order.
